## Abstract

The project is given birth due to the need to analyze a set of electrophysiology recording data and the curiosity of finding the best way to generate and present the result, and to simplify the entire electrophysiology analysis in a simple automated protocol. Comparing to the traditional method, which spends 17640 minutes (around 300 hours) to analyze the 441 cases of data files in our current stage, my method only takes less than 10 minutes, which is 1764 times faster and saves 300 hours. My method also integrates various new features such as excel-friendly log and recursive file search. I hope this method described in this documentation can offer a more systematic and convenient way in the anlaysis of electrophysiology recording data. I look forward to further improvements if any. After tens of hours of my working each week to develop this automated protocol, I hope lab members in the future can simply run the program in 10 minutes to save their time and lives profoundly.
